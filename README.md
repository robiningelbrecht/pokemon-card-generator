This PHP script uses AI to generate new, random Pokemon cards by using 
 - `GPT` to generate a name and description
 - `Stable Diffusion` to create a visual
 - [Pok√©mon TCG](https://github.com/PokemonTCG/pokemon-tcg-data) for accurate moves sets
 - [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) for accurate element types

First of all, thanks to [Jack](https://github.com/pixegami) for the amazing work 
on the [Python equivalent](https://github.com/pixegami/pokemon-card-generator) of
this repository. I was inspired by his creativity to generate Pok√©mon cards out of thin air, 
although I came up with a slightly different approach.

## Installation

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:robiningelbrecht/pokemon-card-generator.git
# Build docker containers
> docker-compose up -d --build
# Install dependencies
> docker-compose run --rm php-cli composer install
```

## Configuration

For this script to work you'll need two different API keys

### OpenAI

* Set up an OpenAI account by navigating to https://beta.openai.com/signup
* Create an API key on https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

### Replicate.com

* Set up a Replicate account by navigating to https://replicate.com/signin
* Copy your API key from https://replicate.com/account

The model used for generating visuals is [OpenJourney](https://replicate.com/prompthero/openjourney).
It's a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on Midjourney v4 images.

<sub>Both accounts have free tiers at first, but after a while you will need to enter
credit card details. It'll cost you around 1-2 cents to generate a card.</sub>

### .env

Copy `.env.dist` and rename to `.env`, it should at least contain following info:

```dotenv
OPEN_AI_API_KEY=your-open-ai-api-key
REPLICATE_API_KEY=your-replicate-api-key
```

## Generate your first card

At this point, you should be locked and loaded to generate your first Pok√©mon card by running

```bash
> docker-compose run --rm php-cli bin/console app:card:generate
```

Your CLI should output something along the lines of

You'll be able to view your card and all information used to generate it, 
by navigating to the card gallery page: `http://localhost:8080/`.

### CLI command options

```
-t, --cardType        The card type you want to generate, omit to use a random one. Valid options are dark, electric, fighting, fire, grass, normal, psychic, steel, water
-r, --rarity          The rarity of the Pok√©mon you want to generate, omit to use a random one. Valid options are common, uncommon, rare
-s, --size            The size of the Pok√©mon you want to generate, omit to use a random one. Valid options are xl, l, m, s, xs
-c, --creature        The creature the Pok√©mon needs to look like (e.g. monkey, dragon, etc.). Omit to to use a random one
-e, --evolutionSeries Indicates if you want to generate a series that evolve from one another. Options "size", "rarity" and "numberOfCards" will be ignored
-x, --numberOfCards   The number of cards to generate. A number between 1 and 10 [default: 1]
-f, --fileType        The image file type you want to use. Valid options are svg, png [default: "png"]
-g, --gptVersion      GPT version to use. Valid options are 3, 4 [default: 4]
-h, --help            Display help for the given command. When no command is given display help for the list command
```

<sub>The PNG slightly differs from the SVG because the latter allows for more flexibility while generating the image<sub>
